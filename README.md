# Hamlet NLP + LLM Paraphrasing Analysis

This project explores how large language models (LLMs) interpret and rephrase Shakespeare's *Hamlet* using **LangChain**, **Ollama**, and classic **NLP techniques**.  
We paraphrase the original lines into natural modern English, then run sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and lexical comparisons between the original and AI-generated versions.

## Dataset

The original dataset comes from the [TidyTuesday project](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/main/data/2024/2024-09-17), featuring line-by-line Hamlet dialogue, including:

- `act`  
- `scene`  
- `character`  
- `dialogue`  
- `line_number`  

The file `hamlet_paraphrased.csv` includes a `paraphrased` column with modern English rewrites.

## Pipeline Overview

**Input** â†’ Shakespearean dialogue from `hamlet.csv`  
**LangChain PromptTemplate** â†’ Prompt formatting  
**Ollama** â†’ Local LLMs (`mistral`, `phi`)  
**Output** â†’ `paraphrased` lines  
**Analysis** â†’ Sentiment, topics, emotion arcs

## Technologies & Libraries

- **LangChain + Ollama** â€“ Prompt orchestration & local inference  
- `pandas`, `numpy` â€“ Data manipulation  
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` â€“ Visualization  
- `nltk`, `textblob` â€“ Sentiment + tokenization  
- `wordcloud` â€“ Frequency visualization  
- `gensim`, `bertopic` â€“ Topic modeling (LDA + transformer-based)  
- `transformers` â€“ T5, BART for baseline comparison

## NLP + LLM Analysis

- Paraphrasing: Original â†’ Modern English  
- Sentiment comparison: Original vs paraphrased  
- Topic modeling: LDA and BERTopic  
- Character-wise emotion profiling  
- Lexical analysis (vocab size, sentence complexity)  
- Line-by-line visual comparison

---

## Key Insights

- **Tone Shift**: Emotions were softened in paraphrasing  
- **Thematic Change**: Central motifs remained, but nuance sometimes lost  
- **Character Shift**: Supporting roles became simpler in tone  
- **LLM Performance**: Fast and private inference with Ollama models
